Typescript course

npm commands 						<-- available after intalling node js
npm init -y							<-- will create the package.json file in app folder of your app
npm install typescript --save-dev	<-- installs typescript as dev dependency allowing you to compile typescript ( i.e to javascript)
npm run								<-- npm command to run scripts. script must be specified in the script section of package json. e.g   "scripts": {"tsc": "tsc" } allows to run   npm run tsc
npm run tsc -- --init				<-- a tsconfig file should appear in the project i.e the config file for typescript
npm run tsc 						<-- typescript compile command. NB: looks at config file above to determine how to compile.  Emitted files are placed in outDir specified in config file
npm start                           <-- runs the "start" script. see the script in package.json




https://caniuse.com/  <-- good for determining what is supported on browsers

The debugger works on the browser cause we have enabled typescript to create our source maps in tsconfig. that's what enables us to debug type scriptcodee in the browser.
Remember that the browser ionly understands javascript. Try to avoid tye "any" in typescript as much as possible cause it undermines the purpose of types in typescript
